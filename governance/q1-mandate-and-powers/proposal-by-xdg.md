# Perl Language Governance: Preamble, Mandate and Powers

## Preamble

We are forming a system of governance for development of the Perl programming
language.

The scope of governance includes the language definition, its
implementation, its test suite, its documentation, and the policies and
procedures by which it is developed and maintained.

A system of governance includes one or more groups that make will
decisions, the rules by which these groups are formed and changed, and the
enumerated powers and constraints on the activities of governing groups.

In forming a system of governance, we seek to achieve the following goals:

- We want a system that is functional.  That means the governing groups
  may decide to undertake large changes, or they may decide to act
  conservatively, but they will act with intent and clear communication
  rather than fail to reach decisions when needed.

- We want a system that is trusted. That means that a reasonable
  contributor to Perl might disagree with decisions made by the governing
  groups, but will accept that they were made in good faith in
  consultation with relevant communities outside the governing groups.

- We want a system that is sustainable.  That means it has provisions to
  self-modify, including ways of adding new members to the governing
  groups, ways to survive members becoming inactive, and ways of amending
  the rules of governance themselves if needed.

- We want a system that is transparent.  That means that it will prefer
  policies that manage ordinary matters in public, and it will prefer
  secrecy in a limited number of situations.

- We want a system that is respectful.  That means that it will establish
  standards of civil discourse that allow for healthy disagreement but
  avoid rancor and hostility in the community for which it is responsible.

## Mandate

Perl language governance shall work to:

- Maintain the quality, stability, and continuity of the Perl language and
  interpreter

- Guide the evolution of the Perl language and interpreter

- Establish and oversee the policies, procedures, systems, and mechanisms
  that enable a community of contributors to the Perl language and
  interpreter

- Encourage discussion and consensus among contributors as preferential to
  formal decision making by governance groups

- Facilitate communication between contributors and external stakeholders
  in the broader Perl ecosystem

## Powers and Limitations

Perl language governance has broad authority to make decisions about the
development of the Perl language, the interpreter, and all other components,
systems and processes that result in new releases of the language
interpreter.

For example, it can:

- Manage the schedule and process for shipping new releases

- Establish procedures for proposing, discussing and deciding upon changes
  to the language

- Add members to or remove members from governance groups

- Delegate power to individuals outside governance groups

- Amend the rules and processes of governance, including granting or restricting
  powers to governance groups (including or restricting the power of amendment)

Perl language governance is limited and does not have any authority over
parts of the Perl ecosystem unrelated to developing and releasing the
language itself.  These include, but are not limited to:

- The Perl Foundation

- CPAN administration and CPAN authors

- perl.org, metacpan.org, and other community-maintained websites and services

- Perl conferences and events, except those sponsored directly by a
  governing group

- Perl-related intellectual property legally owned by third-parties,
  except as allowed by applicable licenses or agreements.
