# Perl Core Member Status

…as self-reported by replies to a "who is out there?" request from Nicolas R.

They were given the choices of:

1. active - I'm reading this list and thus an active member
2. present - I'm a member, but need more time to catchup on discussion. And cannot consider myself as 'active'
3. please unsubscribe me

Rik rounded any "well, halfway between" response to the more-active option.
